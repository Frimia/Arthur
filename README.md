## Arthur

Arthur - Another one of those bots that does things. It has an active developer, at least for now. He'll probably respond to anything you ask him within a short amount of time.

Arthur does have some hot features that other bots don't, but not that many. To list a few, `mp3` which downloads and converts YouTube videos to mp3, and `webshot` which takes a full-length shot of a website. And I think the leveling system is pretty damn nice, but who knows. More features are always being added because the developer is very slow to add things, but probably will get around to them eventually.

I guess the overall point of this is that Arthur is like a nice multipurpose bot that won't ever include moderation features *because every other bot does that*. Yeah, that's all. I dunno.
